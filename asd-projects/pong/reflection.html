The gamplay would be built like a disco where theres a ball and the there would be two sides with disco dancning people and a disco ball representing the ball.
The conditions when the gameplay begins is a countdown from 3 and start in the middle of both players so they can get a even start and who ever guess a number from 1 to 7 they would get first hit.  
The game would be first to 7. When it ends it would say "player 1 " player 2" the victor who ever won.
If both players are tied up and theres a draw then there would be a reset where they have to guess a number, but to avoid a tied game its win by 1 so whoever scores the next point if its 7 : 7 wins.

Visual Game Components

The game compnents would be a disco ball, two dancing people as the pongs,and a dance floor. The dance floor would be static and the dancing pong people and the disco would be animated.
I would need to manage the positons of the disco ball, keyboard events for the two dancing people and the players, the speed of the ball(debating if it should be a constant speed or a gradual speed after each hit.)the points system give the point to the person who scoreed the point.The word that pops up once a person score and win.

Events/Logic

There won't be a timer because the points are low but therer wouild be keyboard events up , down (arrows) w , s (for up , down movement for player 1)
Clicking event for play again.
These affect the data of the game by regirsting
